# Simulation-of-heterogeneous-server-clusters

## Problem
The purpose of this project is to understand how the distribution of client tasks to servers can be better done with different processing rate, so that overall resource utilization is maintained high.

## Solution :pencil:
To answer this question we compare two routing algorithms in a network with 1 dispatcher and 9 servers-workers.The comparison conditions are **average waiting time**,
**average rate application service** , **average total node utilization** and **average utilization per node**
